# DCSS_Sound4Webtiles
Hacky cobble-y-fication of the Korean webtiles sound script realized as a GreaseMonkey script.

Disclaimer: I am not a WebDev.
This addon will eat up your RAM if you refresh the page too much, I am too inexperienced to fix this.

I went for the route of embedding the sound files as base64 strings, which bloats the script and makes it a pain to edit and possibly view, if your text editor sucks, but it loads quite snappily.
